    "Python is an interpreted, dynamic, object-oriented programming language that is very powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is *interpreted*, as the code that you write is read on the spot by a Python interpreter and runs line by line through your code. Other languages may be *compiled* (e.g. C, Cpp), which means that your code first has to be translated into a version that your (and usually only your) particular computer can understand. This makes it **powerful** as you can run the same Python program on many different computers (for instance, your computer and the Minerva cluster) as long as the Python interpreter is installed without having to re-compile and install it."

The one we are using right now is called the [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) which is a Python IDE which you start from a Terminal window (or from the Jupyter shortcut on windows) and is displayed in the web browser. In the past, the **Jupyter** notebook was called the **IPython** notebook, and you may see some older versions of tutorials that use them interchangably.\n",

Jupyter notebooks are configured to run Python by default, but you can also use them to write and run R code.\n",
